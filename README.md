Getting Started with Rake
=========================

A friendly introduction to rake, dependency programming, and being more productive.

Prerequisites
============+
In order to take advantage of this introduction to rake, you will need to have your environment setup properly. You will need to have a current generation Ruby installed. This means if you are on Mac OS X, you will not be using the default Ruby install.

To help you in managing your Ruby environemnt, we will introduce you to _rbenv_, which will help you to create a sandbox environment in which to work, without polluting your standard environment.

My instructions below assume that you are on Mac OS X. If you are running on Linux or Windows, you will have to adapt them as required.

### brew
As part of this process, you will need to install various packages that will need to be built from source. To ease that process for you, I recommend that you install the Mac OS X package manager, _brew_.
